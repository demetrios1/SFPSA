## Introduction and usage
This code implements the methods from the paper Do forecasts of bankruptcy cause bankruptcy? A machine learning sensitivity analysis.

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
dataset%>%
ggplot(aes(x=diff))+

               fill='black')+
               ggtitle('All observations')+
               ylab('Density')+xlab('Individual Risk Differences')+
               xlim(0,.50)+theme_minimal(base_size = 16)+

### Integration
This is the code for the integration.  Right now, you can use bart, monotone bart, or random forest, although more models will likely be added.  We also have a balanced cross-validation function for the monotone bart and bart model.  

This integration takes a mean of the posterior draws and uses that as the passed probability for each obvservation in the integration optimization step.  One could also optimize the entire dataset for all the posterior draws of the joint probabilities of treatment/outcome for each observation.  However, doing so is quite the computational strain, so we do not currently include this feature. 
Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/demetrios1/Causallysensitive/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
